# Pack-Your-Bag-Android-Application

Let me introduce my new project, "Pack Your Bag"
It's a useful Android app built with Java.

Key Features:

--> "Pack Your Bag" is here to solve the common problem of forgetting essential items while traveling.

--> I covered all default categories, but you're in control. Add your items to pack efficiently for any trip.

--> Also provided All 4 CURD operations, Create, Update, Retrieve, and Delete items effortlessly.

--> Java is a widely used language, and it will have a strong community, that's why I used to prefer it. 

For the internal database, I used the Android Room library, Therefore I easily perform operations on the database because the room library has predefined queries and many more.
